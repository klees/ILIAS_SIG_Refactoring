# ILIAS SIG Refactoring

The SIG Refactoring wants to plan, propose and initiate refactorings of
the ILIAS core to enhance maintainability and extensibility of ILIAS, 
thus making the live of the ILIAS developers easier and better. It sees
itself as a servant for all ILIAS developers and it's strongly interested
in their input and opinions.

This is a workspace of the SIG, meant to collaboratively write concepts.
